## Achievements 

I came in second place in the Analytics Olympiad finals! I also attended the award ceremony. Feeling good about myself!

I built a website for the olympiad finals based on the concept of my product.

## Academics
 
I tried to write a program for the Programming Technology lab assignment, incorporating a graphics library. It was an interesting experience.

## Free Time

This week was my birthday! I finally turned 18, yay!

## Overall

It was an interesting week, but not super productive.
