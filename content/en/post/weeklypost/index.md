## Academics
This week was more chill and focused on relaxation. I completed my Programming Technology lab assignment. I also aced my Korean language exam, scoring the highest in the group! Feeling proud of myself.

## New Adventures
I tried installing and getting familiar with Scilab. It reminded me a lot of Pascal, the language that started my programming journey.

## Free Time
Finally finished reading "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott. Feeling a bit empty now. The movie with Timoth√©e Chalamet is a complete flop compared to the book :(
