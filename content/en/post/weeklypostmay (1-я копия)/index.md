# Academics: 
## Exam season is approaching! Lots of tests to prepare for. I'm proud of myself for completing a challenging extra assignment in math logic. As a result, I'll be able to finish the semester without exams.
## I also tried writing a program for Programming Technology that included a database, which was a very interesting experience. 

# Free Time: 
## Surprisingly, despite being busy, I managed to watch a couple of great movies â€“ good old classics. "The Intouchables" and "The Gentlemen" left a great impression. I'm happy with my choices!

## Last week, Moscow had "Museum Week," and I was able to visit the Museum of Cosmonautics at VDNKh.

## Overall, it was an interesting, albeit hectic week.
