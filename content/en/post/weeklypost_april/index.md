## Academics
This week was all about exams! I finished my math logic and calculus tests.  I also aced another Korean language test, scoring the highest again! 

## New Adventures
I made it to the finals of an analytics olympiad and started working on developing the website I proposed in the semi-finals.

## Free Time
I went to an exhibition dedicated to the phenomenon of "manga," but for me, it was specifically about "manhwa."

I learned that to be a Korean translator, you only need to have a level 3 "gyp" (Korean language proficiency level). I think I'll be able to confirm my level soon and try my hand at that kind of work.

## Overall
It was a pretty productive week, I'm happy!
