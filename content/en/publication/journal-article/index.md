## As a first-year student at RUDN, studying "Business Informatics" on a paid basis, I'm happy to share my experience of getting into this prestigious university.

## The process started long before graduation exams at school. I carefully studied information about RUDN, its programs, and requirements for applicants. Since I chose "Business Informatics", I paid special attention to the subjects taken in the Unified State Exam - Russian language, profile mathematics and English.

## When it was time to submit documents, I carefully filled out all necessary forms and prepared a package of documents in accordance with the requirements of the admissions committee. This included a certificate, photos, copies of my passport and other identification documents, as well as documents confirming my paid education.

## Then, I anxiously awaited the results of the entrance examinations. To my joy, my efforts paid off, and I successfully passed the competitive selection. When I saw my name on the list of enrolled students, I felt a huge sense of pride and gratitude for the opportunity to become part of the RUDN student community.

## Now, as a RUDN student, I am looking forward to the start of the academic process and the opportunity to prove myself within the walls of this wonderful university. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained here will become the foundation for my further professional and personal development in the field of business informatics.
